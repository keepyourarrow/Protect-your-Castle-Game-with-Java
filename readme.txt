It's a game where you are a Wizard who is desperately trying to maintain his peace, but what to do when unwanted foreign invaders 
are disturbing the time of your life? Get rid of all enemies to win. 
This game is just my practice project and the first game i've ever made. It has a basic features like moving(key Input), 
camera, shooting. Always moving monsters, textures, spritesheet. Collision effects.

It's a simple game and it's not perfect (and it has just one simple level with no challenge). But most importantly, it taught me the
very basics of game development, how to make your own games. I learned a ton, also had a great practice with Object Oriented programming.
Overall a great experience. And it doesn't look that bad for my first game, so i should be satisfied... No! i set my sight on much higher
goals to be content with where i am right now.
